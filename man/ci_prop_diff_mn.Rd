\usage{
ci_prop_diff_mn(x, by, conf.level = 0.95, delta = NULL, data = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A binary vector representing all responses. Can also be a column
name if a data frame provided in the `data` argument.}

\item{by}{A character or factor vector with exactly two unique levels
identifying the two groups to compare. Can also be a column name if a data
frame provided in the `data` argument.}

\item{conf.level}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the confidence
level. Default is 0.95 (95\% confidence).}

\item{delta}{Optional numeric value(s) for hypothesis testing. If provided, the
function returns the test statistic and p-value under the `delta`
hypothesis.}

\item{data}{Optional data frame containing the variables specified in `x` and `by`.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:

  \item{estimate}{The point estimate of the difference in proportions (p_x - p_y)}
  \item{conf.low}{Lower bound of the confidence interval}
  \item{conf.high}{Upper bound of the confidence interval}
  \item{conf.level}{The confidence level used}
  \item{method}{Description of the method used ("Miettinen-Nurminen Confidence Interval")}
If `delta` is provided the list will have two additional compnents:
  \item{statistic}{Z-Statistic under the given `delta` null hypothesis}
  \item{p.value}{p-value under the given `delta` null hypothesis}
}
\description{
Calculates the Miettinen-Nurminen (MN) confidence interval for the difference
between two proportions. This method can be more accurate than traditional
methods, especially with small sample sizes or proportions close to 0 or 1.
}
\details{
The function implements the Miettinen-Nurminen method to compute
confidence intervals for the difference between two proportions. This
approach:

1. Computes the test statistic across a range of possible difference values
(delta) 2. Identifies values of delta where the test statistic falls within
the critical region determined by the confidence level 3. Returns the minimum
and maximum acceptable values as the confidence interval bounds

The method uses a score test with a small-sample correction factor, making it
more accurate than normal approximation methods, especially for small samples
or extreme proportions. The equation for the test statistics is as follows:
\deqn{T_{MN} = \frac{\hat{p}_x - \hat{p}_y - \delta}{\sqrt{V_{\delta}}}}

where:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{\hat{p}_x} and \eqn{\hat{p}_y} are the observed proportions in the two groups
  \item \eqn{\delta} is the hypothesized difference
  \item \eqn{V_{\delta}} is the variance estimate under the null hypothesis
        \eqn{V_{\delta} = \lambda(\tilde{p}_x(1-\tilde{p}_x)/n_x + \tilde{p}_y(1-\tilde{p}_y)/n_y)}
  \item \eqn{\lambda = N/(N+1)} is a small sample correction factor
  \item \eqn{\tilde{p}_x} and \eqn{\tilde{p}_y} are the restricted maximum likelihood estimates
        under the constraint that \eqn{\tilde{p}_x - \tilde{p}_y = \delta}
  \item \eqn{\tilde{p}_x = 2ucos(w) - b/3a} and  \eqn{\tilde{p}_y = \tilde{p}_x - \delta}
  \item \eqn{w = \frac{\pi + cos^{-1}(v/u^3)}{3}}
  \item \eqn{v = \frac{b^3}{27a^3}-\frac{bc}{6a^2}+\frac{d}{2a}}
  \item \eqn{u = \frac{v}{|v|}\sqrt{\frac{b^2}{9a^2}+\frac{c}{3a}}}
  \item \eqn{a = 1 + \theta}
  \item \eqn{b = -(1 + \theta + \tilde{p}_x + \theta\tilde{p}_y + \delta(\theta + 2))}
  \item \eqn{c = \delta^2 + \delta(2\tilde{p}_x + \theta + 1) + \tilde{p}_x + \theta\tilde{p}_y}
  \item \eqn{d = -\tilde{p}_x\delta(1+\delta)}
  \item \eqn{\theta = n_y / n_x}

# Generate binary samples
